# CodeDojo-The-Art-of-Testing

Welcome to CodeDojo: The Art of Testing, a unique journey where the ancient art of martial warfare meets the modern world of iOS development and testing. In this project, we delve into the realms of unit, UI, and integration testing, guided by the principles of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War". Here, two legendary martial arts dynasties prepare for an epic confrontation, each battle and strategy mirrored in our tests.

## Goals
This project aims to:
- Provide a comprehensive suite of tests covering Unit, UI, and Integration testing.
- Utilize Apple's standard testing framework along with Quick and Nimble for expressive BDD-style tests.
- Create an engaging narrative that parallels our testing scenarios, making learning and exploration of testing principles an adventure.
- Foster understanding and mastery of testing practices in iOS development.
- Serve as a reference and learning tool for iOS developers looking to enhance their testing skills.

## Testing Frameworks
- **XCTest**: For unit testing, ensuring the reliability of our code at a fundamental level.
- **XCUITest**: For UI testing, verifying that the user experience meets our high standards.
- **Quick & Nimble**: For behavior-driven development, adding clarity and expressiveness to our tests.

## The Dynasties
### Dynasty 1: [Name & Brief Description]
### Dynasty 2: [Name & Brief Description]

Each dynasty represents a set of coding methodologies, principles, and challenges, encapsulated in our testing scenarios.
